# Spotify Playlist Analyzer

This project is a personal Python tool that lets users upload their Spotify playlist data (in CSV format) and query songs by mood, vibe, or category.  
It uses song metadata such as danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and more to filter and return matching songs.

## Features

- Load Spotify playlist CSV data and parse it into Python objects  
- Filter songs based on mood or vibe categories (e.g., sad songs, fast-paced songs)  
- Prepare the groundwork for integration with OpenAI API for conversational querying
